          <p id="bio"> I am an aspiring programmer, who wants everything and anything that
          has to do with tech. My interest in technology started in highschool when I discovered that I can learn photoshop on my own on the internet.
          A few years later, I learned to build my own desktop. Unfortunately, I was a very shy teen so I decided to major in Communications and
          set aside programming. I enjoyed learning so much in the University that I proceeded to get a Master's degree. Finally, here I am now,
          in a coding bootcamp with new friends, learning how to create cool stuff with code.

          <p>Masters of Management - Course focusing on strategic management, where I learned how to look at business related problems holistically -
            analyzing all the functional areas of management such as finance, operations, human resources, and marketing to get a better understanding
            of a company's SWOT. In this institution, I learned how to talk and do presentations in front of CEOs and experts from various industries.
            I was also given the opportunity to join a business case competition with participants coming from various Asian universities. This course also
            enabled me to create a business strategy for a medium sized real estate company.
